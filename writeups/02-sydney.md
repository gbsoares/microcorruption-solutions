# Sydney - Buffer Overflow Introduction

**Difficulty:** Beginner  
**Date Completed:** [Date]  
**Time Taken:** [Duration]

## Challenge Description

Sydney introduces the concept of buffer overflows in the MSP430 architecture. This challenge teaches about stack layout, return addresses, and basic control flow hijacking.

## Initial Analysis

### Code Overview

[Describe the main functions and program flow]

### Key Functions

- `main()`: [Description]
- `check_password()`: [Description]
- `gets()`: [Description of vulnerable function]

## Stack Layout Analysis

```text
Stack Layout:
[Higher addresses]
+------------------+
| Return Address   |  <- Target for overflow
+------------------+
| Saved Frame Ptr  |
+------------------+
| Local Buffer     |  <- Overflow source
+------------------+
[Lower addresses]
```

## Assembly Analysis

```assembly
[Include relevant assembly code snippets with annotations]
```

## Vulnerability Identification

[Describe the buffer overflow vulnerability]

### Root Cause

[Explain the technical details of the vulnerability]

## Exploit Development

### Strategy

[Explain your approach to exploiting the buffer overflow]

### Buffer Overflow Analysis

- Buffer size: [X bytes]
- Offset to return address: [Y bytes]
- Target address: [0xZZZZ]

### Payload Construction

```python
# Python script to generate payload
buffer_size = X  # Size of buffer
padding = "A" * buffer_size
return_address = "\xZZ\xZZ"  # Target address in little-endian
payload = padding + return_address
```

### Final Payload

```text
[Final hex payload]
```
