# Microcorruption.com Solutions

This repository documents my solutions and progress through the embedded security CTF exercises at [microcorruption.com](https://microcorruption.com/).

## About Microcorruption

Microcorruption is a series of embedded security challenges focused on a variant of the MSP430 microcontroller. Each level presents a lock that must be bypassed by finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in the firmware.

Note: the solutions can differ from user-to-user, so the password I post does not necessarily solve the puzzle on your session. Rather you need to follow the same procedures to obtain the password.
